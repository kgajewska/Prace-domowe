##Task

Try two models: simple linear regression model with just one dependent variable and a model which takes into account spatial structure of measurements (variables east and north).

Compare these two models and answer the question: is there a significant relation between variables thick (y) and soil (dependent variable)?

## Dataset

```{r}
spdata <- read.table("http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/r/faq/thick.csv", header = T, sep = ",")
head(spdata)

```

## Model 1 : simple linear regression model

```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(spdata, aes(x = soil, y = thick)) + 
      geom_point(shape = 1) +   
      geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE, color="red", size=2)

```

```{r}
Regmodel <- lm(thick~ soil, data=spdata)
summary(Regmodel)

```

## Model 2: from page with hints

```{r}
ggplot(spdata, aes(soil, thick)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE, color="red", size=2)

```


```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(nlme)
soil.model <- lme(fixed = thick ~ soil, data = spdata, random = ~ 1 | dummy, method = "ML")
summary(soil.model)
```

Despite the fact, that the relation between thick and soil doesn't seem to be  linear, Model 1 and Model 2 show that the relation between soil and thick is significant.

## Spatial correlation for "thick"

```{r, warning = FALSE}
library(ade4)
mantel.rtest(dist(spdata[,2:3]), dist(spdata$thick))
```

We have p-value = 0.01, so for alpha <0.01, we can assume that  spatial correlation exist. The graph below confirms the truth of this sentence.

```{r, warning = FALSE, echo=FALSE, message = FALSE}
#library(plotly)
#plot_ly(spdata, x = east, y = north,  type="scatter", mode = "markers", color = #thick)
```

Based on this graph, we can say that the points which are in a similar location, have similar values for thick. 

## Model with spatial correlation structures

```{r}
soil.gau <- update(soil.model, correlation = corGaus(1, form = ~ east + north), method = "ML")
summary(soil.gau)
```

Now we have very high p-value, so soil is not significant. 

##Conclusions

Incorporating the Gaussian correlation structure in model, we can observe that soil is not a statistically significant predictor of thick. Without the spatial structure, this relationship becomes is significant.
